# 3D Printed Parts

## `track_bender.blend`
This Blender file contains one segment of the track blender jig; it should be exported scaled up by 1000.  The exported `.stl` file is also included.  I printed five of these in 0.2 mm "fast" resolution on my Prusa MK3 3D printer with 20% in-fill.  See [here](http://www.meades.org/railways/garden/garden.html#rail_preparation) for further instructions on how I used this jig to bend track.
